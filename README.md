# Search Algorithms Efficiency

### Objective
This project aims to compare the efficiency of linear and binary search algorithms.

### Problem

Evaluate and compare the efficiency of linear and binary search, by analyzing their time and space complexity in practical scenarios.



### Implementation

- Implement Both Search Algorithms.
- Create a random array.
- Measure the time to find the same element using both search methods.
- Measure the space to find the same element using both search methods.
- Analyze how the time taken grows with the size of the array.
- Analyze how the space is taken with the size of the array.
- Is there an enhancement that can be applied to any scenario?

### Qualification to pass
- [ ] The code must execute without errors.
- [ ] Write all requirements correctly.
- [ ] Both scenarios must be fully completed.
- [ ] Submit your project by making a pull request on GitHub and sending the source code via email.
