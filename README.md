# Search Algorithms Efficiency

### Objective
This project aims to compare the efficiency of the time and space complexity of linear search and binary search algorithms.

### Problem

Evaluate and compare the efficiency of search algorithms, such as linear search and binary search, by analyzing their time and space complexity in practical scenarios.



### Implementation

- Implement Both Search Algorithms.
- Create a sorted array and a random array in separate scenarios.
- Measure the time taken to find elements in both arrays using both search methods.
- Measure the space taken to find elements in both arrays using both search methods.
- Analyze how the time taken grows with the size of the array.
- Analyze how the space is taken with the size of the array.


### Qualification to pass
 - [ ] The code must execute without errors.
- [ ] Write all requirements correctly.
- [ ] Both scenarios must be fully completed.
