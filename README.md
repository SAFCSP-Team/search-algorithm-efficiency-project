# Search Algorithm Efficiency

### Objective
This project aims to compare the efficiency of the time and space complexity of linear search and binary search.

### Problem

Evaluate and compare the efficiency of search algorithms linear search and binary search by analyzing their time complexity and space complexity in practical scenarios.



### Implementation

- Implement Both Search Algorithms.
- Create a sorted array and a random array in separate scenarios.
- Measure the time taken to find elements in both arrays using both search methods.
- Measure the space taken to find elements in both arrays using both search methods.
- Analyze how the time taken grows with the size of the array.
- Analyze how the space is taken with the size of the array.


### Qualification to pass
 - [ ] The code should run successfully.
- [ ]  Write all requirements correctly.
